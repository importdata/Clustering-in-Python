# Clustering-in-Python
Given the dataset of 10,000 of images of handwritten digits (0 - 9), applied clustering algorithms such as KMeans, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN to figure out how clusters are formed. The dataset contained 785 columns, which had the first column as the target digit. The rest of the dataset contains the pixel-values of the associated images. It was necessary to use PCA and TSNE (dimensionality reduction method) to visualize the clusters formed in each of the methods on 2D and 3D graphs. Also, calculated the accuracy of each clustering algorithm.
